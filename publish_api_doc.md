# Documentation with Postman
This is my published API documentation: [Ride API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12553994/TVmS7FFD)
With Postman you can publish your API documentation easily.
* First, you need to download the Postman app, make an account, and login.
* After that, you can start building a collection of endpoints, get responses, add examples, give a title, give a description, etc..
* And then, you can start publishing your documentation by clicking the triple dot symbol next to your collectio name, and click "Publish Docs", and just follow the guide to publish your documentation online.
* For more detail, with easy step-by-step guide, you can visit the "Documenting your API" section from the official Postman Learning Center [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/).
